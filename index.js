const str='Life, the universe and everything. Answer:';
console.log(`${str} ${str.length}`);

//The ${str} inserts the value of str, and ${str.length} inserts the length of the string.
//The string str is: 'Life, the universe and everything. Answer:'
//The length of this string is 42, because there are 42 characters (including spaces and punctuation).

//you can also use console.log(str + str.length); to output the same answer (string concatenation)
//or you can also use cocole.log(str, str.length) to output the same value (multiple arguments in console log)
